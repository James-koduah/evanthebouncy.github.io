### Mentoring Statement


My overall view on research is that:
(1) Great research happens when a group of motivated people are placed in an environment.
(2) We make great discoveries when we are unrushed --- having the _time_ to learn and ponder.

Research as a form of self-expression like arts and music, over a stringent medium of evidence and logic, and attains its value in directing the scientific community. I am interested in mentoring driven students who can take responsibilities of their self-expressions, and helping them ground these expressions into concrete projects.

<!-- Having a good taste -- asking the right scientific questions -- is one of the most difficult challenges you will face in your academic career. In mentoring you, I will help you shape own voice as a researcher.  -->
As scientists, we are responsible for developing, validating, and communicating hypotheses. 
Developing the right hypotheses requires "taste", validating it through experiments requires "operation", and communicating it requires "relatability".
Some of these might come naturally, while others we will improve together as professionals.

If you are interested in collaboration, find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/evanthebouncy) or via email.
<!-- I believe we do our most impactful research when we feel safe and relaxed -- having the peace to learn, having the leisure to ponder. -->

<!-- #### mentoring news
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-04-18 [Saujas Vaduguru](https://twitter.com/saujasv), my collaborator/mentee whom I have been working with for over a year and written a recommendation letter for, has been accepted to CMU as a PhD student under [Daniel Fried](https://twitter.com/dan_fried). The most amazing thing is that I've never met Saujas in person and we collaborated entirely online. I have not met Daniel in person either. I hope to see them in real life soon! ðŸ˜‚ </span> -->
