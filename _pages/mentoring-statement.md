### Mentoring Statement

<ins> "Good Vibes and Good Times" </ins> 

That is what I strive for in any collaboration. We do our best research when we feel safe and relaxed -- having the peace to learn, having the leisure to ponder. 

Research is a form of self-expression just like arts and music, albeit over a more stringent medium of evidence and logic. Having a good taste and finding your own voice in research is one of the most difficult challenges you will face in your academic career. The joy of mentoring is I get to particpate in this process, to help you find your own voice as a researcher.

And, just like arts and music, you need the expertise to realize your vision. As scientists, we are responsible for coming up with good ideas, substantiating good ideas, and explaining these ideas to the right audience. Some of these skills might come naturally to you, while others you will need to practice. My responsibility as a mentor is to help you hone your skills as a professional, so that you can perform at your best.

Each collaboration is different, depending on our relevant interests, expertise, and the stakes at hand. Irrespective of the nature of our collaboration, first and foremost, I am investing in you, to help you (and myself) become a better person/thinker/collaborator/teacher -- a better scientist.
