### Mentoring Statement

<!-- Great research happens when a group of motivated people are placed in an environment

We do our best research when we feel safe and relaxed -- having the peace to learn, having the leisure to ponder.  -->

I view research as a form of self-expression just like arts and music, but over a stringent medium of evidence and logic. I am interested in mentoring motivated students who can take ownership of their own works, to help them express their original scientific ideas.

<!-- Having a good taste -- asking the right scientific questions -- is one of the most difficult challenges you will face in your academic career. In mentoring you, I will help you shape own voice as a researcher.  -->
As scientists, we are responsible for generating good ideas, validating good ideas, and communicating these ideas to the right audience. Some of these skills might come naturally to you, while others you will need to practice. It is my responsibility to sharpen your skills as a professional, so that you can perform at your best.

Each collaboration is different, depending on our relevant interests, expertise, and the stakes at hand. Irrespective of the nature of our collaboration, first and foremost, I am investing in you, to help you (and myself) become a better person/thinker/collaborator/teacher -- a better scientist.


<!-- #### mentoring news
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-04-18 [Saujas Vaduguru](https://twitter.com/saujasv), my collaborator/mentee whom I have been working with for over a year and written a recommendation letter for, has been accepted to CMU as a PhD student under [Daniel Fried](https://twitter.com/dan_fried). The most amazing thing is that I've never met Saujas in person and we collaborated entirely online. I have not met Daniel in person either. I hope to see them in real life soon! ðŸ˜‚ </span> -->
