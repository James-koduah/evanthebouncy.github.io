### Mentoring Statement

<!-- Great research happens when a group of motivated people are placed in an environment

We do our best research when we feel safe and relaxed -- having the peace to learn, having the leisure to ponder.  -->

I view research as a form of self-expression like arts and music, over a stringent medium of evidence and logic, and attains its value in directing the scientific community. I am interested in mentoring self-motivated students who can take responsibilities of their own insights and works, and helping them developing these insights into concrete research outputs.

<!-- Having a good taste -- asking the right scientific questions -- is one of the most difficult challenges you will face in your academic career. In mentoring you, I will help you shape own voice as a researcher.  -->
As scientists, we are responsible for generating good ideas, validating good ideas, and communicating these ideas to the right audience. We must also have good research "taste", as to focus on the "right" problems. Some of these might come naturally, while others we will need to conciously improve. In working with me, we will hone our skills as professionals together. 

If you are interested in collaboration, find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/evanthebouncy) or via email.

<!-- #### mentoring news
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-04-18 [Saujas Vaduguru](https://twitter.com/saujasv), my collaborator/mentee whom I have been working with for over a year and written a recommendation letter for, has been accepted to CMU as a PhD student under [Daniel Fried](https://twitter.com/dan_fried). The most amazing thing is that I've never met Saujas in person and we collaborated entirely online. I have not met Daniel in person either. I hope to see them in real life soon! ðŸ˜‚ </span> -->
