### Collaborators

Here are some professionals that I've worked with closely in reverse chronological order. I hope to give them a brief characiture, as they're more than names that appear beside mine in a publication.

[Marta Kryven](http://mud.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/mkryven/) - Practically taught me how to do human experiments professionally: experiment design, user tutorial, data collection, and how to give a stats data.csv so they can R it. RIP Julio, should've gave it to me -- giving it to Kevin was not the way.

[Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) - Josh is a great scientist. I learned how to become a better scientist just by interaction, observation, and through osmosis. He made me realize I need a clear brand, and to relentlessly iterate on it, hone it, and explain it so it becomes second nature. I know he takes an extra effort to meet with me in his busy schedule, as he owes me no direct obligations (I'm not in his lab). I am grateful for this.

[Maxwell Nye](https://maxwellnye.github.io/) - Made me realize it is important to network in research and having a good institutional awareness on who in who's group does what. Advised me to "try a simpler idea on a bigger scale". Showed me this cool thing called "pragmatics". Hard countered by fries.

[Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/) - Kevin will state at 8pm that he is "calling it a day", only to go home and write so much code by whispering to his computer, and run 3 miles the next morning before you see him again at 11am. Taught me to first write down what plots we wanted in the paper and working backwards. Saved me more than once in pushing bayesian equations around. Gym buddy and swole bro.

[Zachery Miranda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zmiranda/) - First student I mentored. Despite my inexperience Zach was such a good natured and competent person it worked out well. Best Taliyah mid NA, especially in combo with my Rammus gank.

[Zenna Tavares](http://www.zenna.org/) - Introduced me to the computational cogsci universe and how humans are really cool. Owner of the follow up question "in what sense?". Elevated my thinking and cooking by showing me convincing alternatives such as being bayesian and using a blender.

[Leslie Pack Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) - PhD co-advisor. Forced me to distill my effusive research ideas down to a single math expression. Taught me one cannot begin to solve something without quantifying the question first. The strict coach in my corner.

[Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/) - Mentor who introduced me to the world of machine learning on a professional level. In a hands on way showed me how to prioritize and operationalize a ML project. Very calm.

[Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) - The best PhD advisor I could've asked for. Patient, so patient, and encouraging, despite in my 4 years with no publications. A rare PI that doesn't impose his own research agendas strongly, and instead gave his students space to find their own path. Gave me a safe space to find my own voice in research. My role model in finding fulfillment in both research and family.

[Ali Sinan Köksal](https://koksal.org/) - Made me realize that to convince someone of an idea, you needed at least one, concrete point of irrefutable evidence. Encouraged me to start the twitch stream and develop an online presence.

[Ras Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/) - Gave undergrad me a chance at his lab, introduced me to the professional world of research. Nurtured me and held my hand in a manner above and beyond his obligations. 我人生中的贵人
