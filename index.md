Have you ever yelled at your computer before? Did it listen? Why is communicating with a computer so unintuitive, compared to how we communicate with people? 

I believe that by studying computational models of how humans "program" each other, we can build better collaborative programming systems. I curate and analyze human instruction datasets [^larc] (cognitive science); instantiate communicative models within program synthesis algorithms [^prag](artificial intelligence, programming language); and evaluate these algorithms with end-users (human-computer interactions).

I believe good research is a _consequence_ of a good "party" -- both in the sense of having a good team ðŸ‘¥, and having a good time together ðŸŽ‰. Here's [a (non-exhaustive) list](under-construction!) of my collaborators, whom I rely on for their expertise, guidance, and encouragement. My mentoring statement can be found [here](under-construction!).

### news
* <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-09-16: [Communicating Natural Programs to Humans and Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07824) was accepted to NeurIPS 2022 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks. This is one of the largest party I've thrown and it's great to have it find a home! </span>

* <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-04-18 [Saujas Vaduguru](https://twitter.com/saujasv), my collaborator/mentee whom I've never met in person, has been accepted to CMU as a PhD student under [Daniel Fried](https://twitter.com/dan_fried). I hope to see them in real life soon! </span>
