My research is to develop algorithms that can follow human instructions like people can. Humans can precisely understand other peopleâ€™s instructions and can adjust their actions depending on the situation. To build algorithms that can do the same, we need a system that can infer latent goals, and can internally simulate the outcomes of their actions.

My work studies **natural programs** â€” instructions given to a person to carry out a task on a computer (e.g. modifying a 3D scene or writing code). I curate datasets of successful natural programs, and integrate cognitive models to build algorithms that can interpret these natural programs. I work on code generation, computational pragmatics, and grounded semantics of natural language. I maintain close collaborations with researchers from cognitive science, programming languages, and human-computer interactions.

I believe quality research is a consequence of a well planned "party" -- both in the sense of having a well-balanced and efficient team ðŸ‘¥, and enjoying doing great research together ðŸŽ‰.

### news

* <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2023-12-01: Two papers accepted to NeurIPS, [ANPL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18498) and [DiffVL](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70947). The overall theme of both paper is how to use natural language in conjuction with **search** to effectively communicate to machines. </span>

* <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2022-10-13: The first installment to my minimalistic guide to program synthesis [is live!](https://evanthebouncy.github.io/program-synthesis-minimal/). It took me two months to write, get feedbacks, and edit. Hope you find it useful!! </span>
