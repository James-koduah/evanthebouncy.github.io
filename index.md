I build code[^1] generating systems inspired by human communications, enabling them to follow instructions with both flexibility and precision. Human communication is flexible in modality, situations, and conversation partners. Remarkebly, these flexible instructions can convey precise tasks such as writing a program, refining a floor-plan, or operating a machinery. Current instruction following systems are either inflexible (e.g. programming, user interface) or imprecise (e.g. LLM, generative AI). My work aims to develop computational models of human communication, and applying these models to build code generating agents that interact with people. Toward this aim, I elicit instruction [datasets](/datasets/), develop sample efficient instruction following [algorithms](/algorithms/), and evaluate [interactive systems](/interactive-systems/) with user studies.

I am currently a senior research scientist at Autodesk AI Lab. I received my PhD under Armando Solar-Lezama and Leslie Kaelbling at MIT. My [collaborators](/collaborators/) are across disciplines (AI/ML, Cogsci, NLP, Graphics, HCI) and institutions. Here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf), [google scholar (under "Yewen Pu")](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LJnNKXMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [mentoring statement](/mentoring-statement/). For a quick chat, find me on [twitter](https://x.com/evanthebouncy), where I also post updates and news, or via [email](mailto:yewen.pu@autodesk.com).
